# üöÄ Bitspeed Identity Reconciliation Service

Unify your customer profiles with the **Bitespeed Identity Reconciliation Service**\! This high-performance backend service intelligently links user contacts from various sources using their email addresses and phone numbers. Say goodbye to duplicate contacts and hello to a single, unified view of your customers.

-----

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Our service employs a sophisticated identity resolution algorithm to ensure accurate and consistent customer profiles. Here's what it does:

  * **Deduplicates** contact information across multiple data sources.
  * Maintains **hierarchical relationships** between primary and secondary contacts.
  * Provides **real-time contact consolidation** via a robust RESTful API.
  * Guarantees **data consistency** through transactional operations.

## üìù API Documentation

The core of this service is its powerful **Contact Identification Endpoint**.

### Contact Identification Endpoint

This endpoint processes contact information and returns a consolidated contact profile.

  * **Endpoint:** `POST /identify`
  * **Description:** Processes contact information and returns a consolidated contact profile with all associated identities.
  * **Request Headers:**
    ```
    Content-Type: application/json
    ```
  * **Request Body Schema:**
    ```json
    {
      "email": "string | null",
      "phoneNumber": "string | null"
    }
    ```
  * **Response Schema:**
    ```json
    {
      "contact": {
        "primaryContatctId": "string",
        "emails": ["string"],
        "phoneNumbers": ["string"],
        "secondaryContactIds": ["string"]
      }
    }
    ```

### Usage Examples

#### Example 1: New Contact Creation

If a contact doesn't exist, a new primary contact is created.

```bash
curl -X POST https://bitspeed-1-4hnj.onrender.com/identify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "phoneNumber": "1234567890"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "contact": {
    "primaryContatctId": "64f7b8c9e1234567890abcde",
    "emails": ["john.doe@example.com"],
    "phoneNumbers": ["1234567890"],
    "secondaryContactIds": []
  }
}
```

#### Example 2: Contact Consolidation

When existing contacts are related by email or phone, they are linked, and a consolidated profile is returned.

```bash
curl -X POST https://bitspeed-1-4hnj.onrender.com/identify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "phoneNumber": "0987654321"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "contact": {
    "primaryContatctId": "64f7b8c9e1234567890abcde",
    "emails": ["john.doe@example.com"],
    "phoneNumbers": ["1234567890", "0987654321"],
    "secondaryContactIds": ["64f7b8c9e1234567890abcdf"]
  }
}
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The service relies on a flexible **Contact Model** in MongoDB to store and manage contact identities.

### Contact Model

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  phoneNumber: String | null,
  email: String | null,
  linkedId: ObjectId | null,
  linkPrecedence: "primary" | "secondary", // Indicates if it's a primary or secondary contact
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date,
  deletedAt: Date | null
}
```

### Indexes

We use efficient indexing to ensure fast queries:

  * **Compound index** on `(email, phoneNumber)` for quick lookups.
  * **Index** on `linkedId` for efficient relationship queries.
  * **Index** on `linkPrecedence` for effective primary/secondary filtering.
